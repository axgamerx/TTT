  <h1>corner</h1>
  <p>If the opponent goes anywhere but the center, go to the corner directly adjacent to your current x.</p>
  <img src="cc.jpg">
  <p>This forces them to go in between, at which point u place an x to fork them.</p>

  <p>However, if the opponent goes in the middle, you still have a chance to win. Take the opposite corner</p>

  <p>Then, if the opponent goes in anyone of the last 2 corners, you can still fork them.</p>

  <h1>center</h1>
  <p>If the opponent is already familiar with how to play from a corner, you may have to use the center.</p>
  <p>If they go on one of the edges, you have a way to force a win. First, place an x next to their o.</p>
  <img src="me.jpg">
  <p>This forces them to block you in the corner, at which point you can place the x next to both of yours, forking them.</p>
